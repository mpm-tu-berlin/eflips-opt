# eflips-opt

Part of the [eFLIPS/simBA](https://github.com/stars/ludgerheide/lists/ebus2030) list of projects.

This repository contains code for optimizing (electric) bus networks. The following optimization problems are considered:

- [Depot-Rotation Matching](#depot-rotation-matching): Given a set of depots and a set of rotations, find the optimal assignment of rotations to depots.
- [Simplified Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem](#simplified-electric-vehicle-scheduling-problem): Given a set of trips, find the rotation of electric buses that minimizes the total number of vehicles needed to serve all trips.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash 
    git clone git@github.com:mpm-tu-berlin/eflips-opt.git
    ```

2. Install the packages listed in `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` into your Python environment. Notes:
    - The suggested Python version is 3.11.*, it may work with other versions, but this is not tested.
    - Using the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager is recommended. It can be installed according to the
      instructions listed [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

3. In order to use the [Depot-Rotation Matching](#depot-rotation-matching), it is recommended to install the 
4. [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver. The solver can be installed by following the instructions listed [here](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4534161999889-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-Optimizer). 
   The solver can be used with a license for academic purposes. If you do not have a license, you can request one [here](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

## Usage

### Depot-Rotation Matching

Example scripts for the Depot-Rotation Matching problem can be found in the `examples/depot_rotation_matching` directory.
The general usage is as follows:

```python
from eflips.opt.depot_rotation_matching import DepotRotationOptimizer

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = DepotRotationOptimizer(session, SCENARIO_ID)

# Create a depot input. Both existing and new depots can be added.
user_input_depot = [
   {
       "depot_station": 103281393,
       "capacity": 300,
       "vehicle_type": [84, 86, 87, 90],
   },  # Indira-Gandhi-Str
   {
       "name": "Suedost",
       "depot_station": (13.497371828836501, 52.46541010322369),
       "capacity": 260,
       "vehicle_type": [82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 90],
   },  # SÃ¼dost
]
optimizer.get_depot_from_input(user_input_depot)
optimizer.data_preparation()
optimizer.optimize(time_report=True)
optimizer.write_optimization_results(delete_original_data=True)
```

## Development

We utilize the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) branching structure. This means
that the `main` branch is always deployable and that all development happens in feature branches. The feature branches
are merged into `main` via pull requests.

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting. You can use 
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure the code is formatted correctly before committing. You are also free to
use other methods to format the code, but please ensure that the code is formatted correctly before committing.

Please make sure that your `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files are consistent before committing. You can use `poetry check` to check this. This is also checked by pre-commit.
